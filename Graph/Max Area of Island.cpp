üß† Approach (DFS ‚Äì Depth First Search)
        Traverse every cell in the grid.
        When you find land (1), perform DFS to explore the entire island and calculate its area (number of connected 1‚Äôs).
        During DFS, mark each visited cell as 0 (water) to avoid re-counting.
        Keep track of the maximum area found among all islands.
        
        ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Comlexity
        Time Complexity: O(M √ó N) ‚Äî each cell is visited once.
        Space Complexity: O(M √ó N) ‚Äî recursion stack in worst case.
